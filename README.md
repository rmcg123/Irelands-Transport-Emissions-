# Irelands-Transport-Emissions-

A small project to help translate Ireland's overall decarbonisation ambition into sub-targets for the transport sector.

The file Parameters.txt are the set of user-chosen parameters to input into the program Transport_Emissions_Scenarios.py. These parameters include sub-targets regarding avoid, shift and improve for different vehicle types as well as phase-out dates for each type of internal combustion engine vehicle. The program takes these inputs and looks at how emissions, energy usage and passenger mode share would be affected by the achievement of the sub-targets.

There is the option to include international aviation and shipping emissions.
